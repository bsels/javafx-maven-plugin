# javafx-maven-plugin
A lightweight Maven plugin based on the JavaFX Maven Plugin with three goals: fxml‑source generates type‑safe Java classes from FXML at compile time; run launches the app for development; jlink builds a minimal self‑contained runtime image. Requires Java 25+, a modular project, and provides config for packages, debugging, logging, native binaries.
